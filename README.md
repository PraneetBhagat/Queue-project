# Queue-project
This project simulates a party match-making queue using Monte Carlo simulation to study waiting times under different queueing and matching rules. Parties of varying sizes arrive over time, and the goal is to form lobbies of fixed capacity (5 people) while tracking waiting-time performance.
i) Fill Queue (FCFS Lobby Filling): In the Fill Queue algorithm, parties are assigned to lobbies in first-come-first-served (FCFS) order.
ii) Match Queue (Complementary Matching): In the Match Queue algorithm, parties are matched strictly by complementary sizes.
